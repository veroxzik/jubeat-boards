## How to order this board

Upload `jubeat-button-pcb_v1.0.zip` from the `gerbers` folder to your favorite PCB website. JLCPCB is a common one.

For best performance, choose ENIG for your surface finish. This will increase cost by quite a bit, but will significantly reduce the level of corrosion you can expect over the lifetime of the boards. It's up to you.

All other settings can remain the defaults. Thickness should be 1.6 mm.
